# STA234 - Statistical Computing with R
This repository has all my work for the Statistical Computing with R class at Connecticut College, taught by [Priya Kohli](https://www.conncoll.edu/directories/faculty-profiles/priya-kohli/)

The class is an introduction to the R programming language for statistical computing. It covers the basics of R, followed by a wide range of plotting styles using ggplot2, and ends with simple statistical modeling. Throughout the semester, each student completed an individual Data Analysis project and wrote a final report on the it.
